distilgo
========

`distilgo` is a set of tools for working with data from Distil Networks.

Testing
========

To run the tests, just execute `go test ./...` from the command line.

Unfortunately, I'm not sure if I can redistribute the database, so your best
bet is likely to use sample data provided by Distil and/or a trial copy
of the database.
